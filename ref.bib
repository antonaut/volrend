abstract = {A general radiosity method accounting for all interreflections of light between diffuse and non- diffuse surfaces in complex environments is intro- duced. As contrasted with previous radiosity methods, surfaces are no longer required to be perfectly diffuse reflectors and emitters. A com- plete, viewer independent description of the light leaving each surface in each direction is compu- ted, allowing dynamic sequences of images to be rendered with little additional computation per image. Phenomena such as "reflection tracking", reflections following a moving observer across a specular surface are produced. Secondary light sources, such as the light from a spotlight re- flecting off a mirror onto a wail are also accounted for.},
